Assembly should be faster than C. This is because in the translation into machine language, assembly uses an assembler whereas C uses a compiler.

reverse_asm could be made faster by using xor register_name register_name instead of the mov instructions to zero the registers. XORing a register with itself is fast than a MOV.

Without -O2 Flag:
reverse_c = 35
reverse_asm = 10

With -O2 Flag:
reverse_c = 17
reverse_asm = 10
